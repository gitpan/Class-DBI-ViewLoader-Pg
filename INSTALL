NAME
    Build.PL - Build script for Class::DBI::ViewLoader

SYNOPSIS
        perl Build.PL --dsn=dsn
                      --user=username
                      --pass=password

        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

TESTING
    When provided with a dsn (and optional username and password), the unit
    tests of this module create three tables and two views and then attempt
    to load the views into Class::DBI.

    The tables that are created and dropped are: actor, film and role. The
    views are film_roles and actor_roles. Automatically generated primary
    key sequences for the three tables will also be created and dropped.

    If the dsn option is not specifed, all view-loading tests are skipped
    and only pod and API-compatability tests are performed.

    Please do not use a live/production/important database to test this
    module!
